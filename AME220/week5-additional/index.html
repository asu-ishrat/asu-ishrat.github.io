        <p>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us
            all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never
            come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the
            highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</p>


        <p>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because
            they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
            our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling
            to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
